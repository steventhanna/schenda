A tool to help students stay organized

- Use [Ace Editor](http://ace.c9.io/) for editing Markdown.
- Use [Markdown to PDF](https://npmjs.org/package/markdown-pdf) for creating PDF documents from Markdown.
- Use [HTML to PDF](https://github.com/marcbachmann/node-html-pdf) for creating PDF documents from HTML.
- Use [Marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked).  This actually looks promising... Start here.
- Use [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org/).  This also looks promising... Even contains LaTeX.
- Use [Node-Summary](https://github.com/jbrooksuk/node-summary) for summarizing notes... This could be super useful.  Could there even be a mode for summarizing articles, and other blocks of text?  
- Could we incorporate [streamr](http://stosur.info/streamr/)? That would be super cool.

The problem is, is that I don't know if I have the available disk space in order to use the second or third link.
