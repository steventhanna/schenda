A tool to help students stay organized

- Use [Ace Editor](http://ace.c9.io/) for editing Markdown.
- Use [Markdown to PDF](https://npmjs.org/package/markdown-pdf) for creating PDF documents from Markdown.
- Use [HTML to PDF](https://github.com/marcbachmann/node-html-pdf) for creating PDF documents from HTML.
- Use [Marked](https://github.com/chjj/marked).  This actually looks promising... Start here.

The problem is, is that I don't know if I have the available disk space in order to use the second or third link.
